        <p>Description:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>This torture is much less of a device then it is just the course of nature taking place. It consists of a cage and rats along with some hot coils to heat up the cage.</li>

        <p>What it does and why it was used:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Made for forcing confessions out and as a form od public punishment. This ‘device’ was used in Europe during the middle ages and in the Vietnam War. Exposed to extreme measures both the victims and rodents are psychologically and physically abused as they get no water or food. Rats are placed on top of the victim along with a cage or container to restrict them and they are left there with a heating cage that makes the rats go crazy trying to escape causing them to eat the human underneath who is alive. </li>
        </ul>
