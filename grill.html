        <ul>
            <li>It was made to punish St. Lawrence as hehad endangered the perfect at<br />the time for not handing the gold of thechurch to him and instead<br />presenting the hungry and disabled peopleof the town as<br />the treasure of the church.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Art that was made:</p>
        <ul>
