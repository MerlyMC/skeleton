        <h1>Brazen Bull</h1>
        <p>Description:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Made by a tyrant who ruled over Sicily in the 6th century BCE, the brazen bull looks like a regular life size bull made of metal. It's hollow on the inside complete with a door on the outside. This bull rests on top of a fire and when lit the acoustics inside the bull would make it sound as if there were bull noises.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>What it does and why it was used:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The purpose of this device was to execute those who opposed the tyrant and horrify people into agreeing with him. The bull would heat up by the fire lit underneath until it was red, the victims were made to feel terrible anguish as their skin sizzled with the touch of the walls and adding inadequate ventilation led to a slow and painful death. This led to the psychological torture of those who were sent to die and those who were made to watch the public excecutioning. The brazing bull is regarded as one of the most brutal forms of torture in history.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Art that was made:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Antipas being martyred</li>

            <li>Martyrdom of St Eustachius by Francesco Fernandi</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Who died from it:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Saint Antipas</li>
            <ul>
                <li>A bishop of Pergamon, died to cast out demons worshiped by the local population</li>
